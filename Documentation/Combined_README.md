# Final dataset

The final dataset fully came together on December 4, 2018

## Authorship and Attribution
This dataset contains elements from American Kennel Club, Westminster Dog Show, KnowYourMeme, Wikipedia, and The Puppybowl. The code used to create this dataset belongs to myself, Halle Burns, as well as Elizabeth Wickes, my project mentor.

## Semantic Contents
This is my final dataset for this project. Should I have more time to continue parsing through Wikipedia entries and flagging them as relevant or not, the contents of this dataset will change. This dataset contains 9 columns as well as __ number of rows. A single row will detail the popularity ranking of a dog breed, its classification, as well as the number of times that breed has been involved in The Puppybowl, Westminster Dog Show's Best in Show, and KnowYourMeme's confirmed dog memes. Additionally, the number of Wikipedia pages devoted to or strongly representing an individual breed as well as the sum of the words in the Wikipedia pages from the aforementioned column.

## Data Structure
This data is stored in a .csv file. The file contains 9 columns reflecting:
* The popularity ranking from the AKC (numerical)
* Associated breed names from the AKC (textual)
* The AKC classification standard for each breed (categorical)
* The number of times the breed has appeared in the last five years of The Puppybowl (numerical)
* The number of times the breed has appeared in the Westminster Dog Show's Best in Show Winner's list (numerical)
* The number of times the breed has appeared in confirmed memes from the KnowYourMeme site (numerical)
* The JSON pathway associated with each breed name (textual)
* The number of Wikipedia articles associated with each breed name (textual)
* The sum of the number of words of Wikipedia articles associated with each breed name (numerical)
