**Date accessed:** September 16, 2018

**September 20, 2018:** Dataset was uploaded into OpenRefine. Used text faceting and hand-checking to ensure spelling accuracy. Rows deemed unneccessary for the scope of this project were deleted.

**October 17, 2018:** Cleaned data was exported into a new Excel file with 3 other datasets: PuppyBowl, Westminster, and KnowYourMeme.

## Data cleaning assessment
This data file possessed very minimal cleaning, especially since I was only using the most recently reported year (2017). It was uploaded into OpenRefine. This data was text faceted, compared, and then hand-edited as a means of spell checking and identifying that each data point present was unique. The cleaned data was then exported to a new Excel file. In total, the cleaning of this dataset took approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

## Authorship and Attribution
This data was created by and is owned by the American Kennel Club. These records are publically available. The ranked list itself does not have a specific name attached to it, instead being attributed to "AKC Staff." A reproduction request was sent to AKC and I am awaiting their response.

## Semantic Contents
The cleaned version of this datafile consists of 6 columns. The first is the breed name. The other 5 columns represent different years, from 2013 to 2017.

## Collection Process
The collection of this data was incredibly simple. As it existed online already in a tabular format, all I needed to do was copy and paste from the website directly into Excel.

## Data Structure
This data is saved in an Excel file. It is 2 columns across and 191 rows long. Only the data from 2017 is being used for my final dataset.
