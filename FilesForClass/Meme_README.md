**October 17, 2018:** Dataset was created by looking up "dog" in the KnowYourMeme search area. Memes marked as confirmed by the site were then written in an Excel file. In other columns, the year of each meme's emergence as well as any dog breed associated each meme were noted. Once complete, this file was uploaded into OpenRefine. Whitespaces were cleaned and spelling was checked. Cleaned data was exported into a new Excel file with 3 other datasets: PuppyBowl, Westminster, and AKC.

## Data cleaning assessment
This data required quite a bit of curation but very minimal cleaning. Even though this data was compiled straight from the website into Excel by hand, the dataset was still uploaded into OpenRefine to clean any whitespaces, double check spelling, and ensure the uniformity in the date formats. In total, the cleaning aspect of this process took maximum 5 minutes, as there were very few data points being utilized in this set.
