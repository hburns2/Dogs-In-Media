**September 20, 2018:** Dataset was uploaded into OpenRefine. Used text faceting and hand-checking to ensure spelling accuracy. Rows deemed unneccessary for the scope of this project were deleted.

## Data cleaning assessment
This data file possessed very minimal cleaning. Several rows that were indicated as missing data were edited out prior to being uploaded into OpenRefine. Once in OpenRefine, rows deemed unnecessary (name of dog, names of owners, and names of judges) were removed. This left just the breed data. This data was text faceted, compared, and then hand-edited as a means of spell checking. The cleaned data was then exported to a new Excel file and then sorted alphabetically in preparation for combining data. In total, the cleaning of this dataset took approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
