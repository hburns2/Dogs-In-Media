**Date accessed:** September 4, 2018

**October 4, 2018:** Data was cleaned using OpenRefine. Columns deemed unnecessary for the scope of this project were deleted.

**October 17, 2018:** Cleaned data was exported into a new Excel file with 3 other datasets: PuppyBowl, AKC, and KnowYourMeme.

**October 19, 2018:** Permission was officially received from Westminster Dog Show to utilize their data in this project.

## Data cleaning assessment
Minimal cleaning was necessary for this dataset. Several rows that were indicated as missing data were edited out in Excel prior to being uploaded into OpenRefine. Once in OpenRefine, rows deemed unnecessary (name of dog, names of owners, and names of judges) were removed. This left just the breed data. Whitespace was removed. The breed column was then text faceted and evaluated to detect any spelling inconsistencies. Once cleaned, the data was then exported to a new Excel file and then sorted alphabetically in preparation for combining data. In total, the cleaning took approximately 5 to 10 minutes total to complete.
