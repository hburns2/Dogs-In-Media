# ImprobableDogs
So, my research question is, what is the most improbable dog breed (or the underdog breed, so to speak) that has risen to prominence due to media exposure? To elaborate on what that means, I am interested in looking at the changes within dog popularity rankings, particularly those near the bottom of the ranks. I am looking to see if any of those dogs near the bottom experienced a rise in popularity correlating to the aftermath of a major dog-based event. Together, this data will paint a picture and hopefully provide insight as to whether media exposure can help less popular breeds be adopted from humane societies.
