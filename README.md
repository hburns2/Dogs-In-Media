# Analyzing whether media exposure can increase adoption rates of "less popular" dogs breeds, dictated by the American Kennel Club
What is the most improbable dog breed (or the underdog breed, so to speak) that has risen to prominence due to media exposure? To elaborate on what that means, I am interested in looking at the changes within dog popularity rankings, particularly those near the bottom of the ranks. 

I am looking to see if any of those dogs near the bottom experienced a rise in popularity correlating to the aftermath of a major dog-based event. I am in the process of gathering data from specific large-scale dog-centered events that receive significant media exposure.

Together, this data will paint a picture and hopefully provide insight as to whether media exposure can help less popular breeds be adopted from humane societies.
