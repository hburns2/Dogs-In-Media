    "# First steps: Gathering the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to investigate any questions, I first needed to determine which datasets I would be using in this project. While many data sources were considered (some even considered and then discarded after beginning the extraction process), I eventually settled on the following sources and their respective websites. Within my documentation on Github, it is noted exactly which days I first access these sites and when I began to pull data. Versions of each site are saved locally on my computer from the day I began extraction.\n",

    "**Pulling the data**\n",
    "My data was gathered in several different ways. For Westminster and AKC, the data was available in tabular format and easily copy/pasted into Excel to then be cleaned. KnowYourMeme data was gathered manually and entered into an Excel file. For KnowYourMeme, \"dog\" was searched within the database. Any memes marked as \"confirmed\" by the site were noted, along with the year associated with their emergence and the dog breed associated with said meme. For example, the \"Doge\" meme, sporting a Shiba Inu, first appeared in 2010, only to pick up popularity in 2013. The PuppyBowl data, pulled from the starting lineups from the past 5 years. This data was pulled using an XPath expression: //span[@class='more-information global-description']/span/text(). The results were then copy/pasted into an Excel file to then be cleaned. Finally, the Wikipedia data was accessed utilizing a JSON script written by Elizabeth Wickes. The resulting JSON files were then read in using Python and exported to Excel for cleaning purposes."

    "This data source required quite a bit of cleaning, all of which was done in either Execl or OpenRefine, with each year possessing its own specific data cleaning needs. Years 10 and 11 were separated by colons as deliminators. Years 12 - 15 were separated by slashes (however, also contained colons indication name, breed, sex, and location). The first pass of restructuring the data, not to be separated by punctuation but placed into individual columns, occured in Excel. This largely separated out what I needed, but extensive cleaning still needed to occur. Each dataset was uploaded individually into OpenRefine.\n",
    "\n",
    "All files ended up with unnecessary columns that were removed, such as name, sex, fun fact, and age. For X, due to the delimination, the text within \"Breed\" all ended with the word \"Sex\" appended at the end. Using a simple Python script, I removed the word from the Breed column. Additionally, a few of the longer breed names had their information cut off when text was initially extracted from the website, so I manually added the final letters to complete the breed names when needed. XI ended up with \"Breed: \" before the names of each breed which, likewise, was removed using Python within OpenRefine. XII had the most cleaning involved, as the raw data included missing values. Within the raw data, the second column represented team name. However, not every dog had a team name entered. Therefore, some values from the third column, Breed, ended up populating the second column. Since this dataset was relatively small, the migration from one column to the next was done by hand. XIII and XIV were the easiest to clean, as the raw data separated cleanly once parsed by deliminator. However, these later years denoted mixed breed by using \"-\" instead of the earlier \"/\". I ran a simple Python script to replace all instances of \"-\" with \"/\" to create uniformity across all datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset was then text faceted individually to check spelling. Once cleaned, all five files were exported into new Excel files. The data from these were all taken and then combined into a master file. This was then once again uploaded into OpenRefine. The master file had all of the whitespaces removed and then I once again text faceted to ensure spelling was correct and uniform. Once exported back into Excel, the column was sorted alphabetically in preparation for being added to the combined file. Entirely, this cleaning process took approximately 4 hours."

The alphabetized files from other datasets were then run and the counts for each dog breed mentioned was determined. This data was then input into a master file, combining the breeds (in ranked order) from AKC, with columns denoting PuppyBowl, Westminster, and Memes. The rows were filled with how many times each breed was mentioned in each dataset. For example, the Boxer, ranked 11th on AKC popularity, occurred 4 times in the last 5 years of the PuppyBowl, 4 times in Westminster Dog Show, and 1 time in KnowYourMeme. Dogs that possessed data in two or more categories were flagged. Those flagged breeds were then ran through code, received from Elizabeth Wickes, pertaining to the Wikipedia API. This code specifically pulls the namespace, page id, page title, page size, word count, a snippet, and timestamp of last edit and creates a combined JSON file. These 24 breed names then output 24 JSON files of various size.\n",

    "The Python script above was written grabbing the filepaths of each breed JSON file, and exported select information (file name, page id, page title, word count, and snippet) to a new Excel file. This file contains upwards of 15,000 total rows. As suggested by Elizabeth, a Keep column was added. As I go through each file name, I indicate by hand \"t\" for true or \"f\" for false. While some pages are obvious in respect to their inclusion, (i.e. the page \"Pembroke Welsh Corgi\" should be kept), others are harder to judge and may require actually looking up the page on Wikipedia to determine its status. Once completed, all of the \"t\"s will be filtered out and exported to a new file. This new file will be my official Wikipedia dataset. So far, I have spent upwards of 8 hours on this cleaning aspect. This is a first pass, meaning that the t/f markings are based on initial impression / what I can determine just looking at the information provided within the .csv file.\n",
